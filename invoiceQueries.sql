##12. A query to find the total number of invoices for each (and every) customer record
select c.customerName, count(*) from invoices as i join customers as c on i.customerCode = c.customerCode 
	group by c.customerCode having count(*) >= 1;

	join products as p on ip.productID = p.productID;

##16. A query to detect invalid data in invoices as follows. In a single invoice, a particular
	##equipment product should only appear once (since any number of units can be consolidated
	##to a single record). Write a query to find any invoice that includes multiple
	##instances of the same equipment product.
select i.invoiceCode as 'invoice with conflicts', ip.productCode, count(*) as 'Times product appears' from invoices as i 
	join invoiceProducts as ip on i.invoiceID = ip.invoiceID 
	join products as p on ip.productID = p.productID
	where p.prodType = 'E' group by ip.invoiceID, p.prodCode having (count(*)>1);  
  
## This query will find any duplicates     
##select i.invoiceCode as 'invoice with conflicts', ip.productCode, count(*) as 'Times product appears' from invoices as i
	##join invoiceProducts as ip on i.invoiceID = ip.invoiceID 
	##group by i.invoiceCode, ip.productCode having count(*)>1;
    
##17. Write a query to detect a possible conflict of interest as follows. No distinction is
	##made in this system between a person who is the primary contact of a client and a
	##person who is also a sales person. Write a query to find any and all invoices where the
	##salesperson is the same as the primary contact of the invoiceâ€™s customer.
select invoiceCode as 'conflicting invoices' from invoices as i 
	join customers as c on c.customerCode = i.customerCode 
	join persons as p on i.personID = p.personID
	where i.personID = c.personID;
